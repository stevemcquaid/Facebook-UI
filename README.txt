I heavily utilize object oriented approaches, often to an extreme.  The CSS stylesheet may look a bit foreign to a designer, but any programmer will feel right at home.

There are a few external dependencies, my solution utilizes:

PHP 5.2.17

LESS CSS Framework (embedded Javascript to compile layout.less file, as well as a backup layout.css file) http://www.lesscss.org

Public Domain CSS Reset: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ v2.0 | 20110126

In the future, I would like to improve upon the tiling algorithm of the calendar events.  Currently, they merely stretch left and their placement is dependent upon the original placement in the grid.  Sliding the events among columns before expanding the widths could yield larger event elements as well as a more full and elegant canvas.
